This Chrome extension reminds you of articles you have read (with a filter for time spent), and allows you to add recaps so you can review them later (more functionality to add around that).

This tries to filter to articles, blogs, and podcasts (also showing github pages for now)

To run:
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Turn on Developer mode on the right
- Go to "Load unpacked" and select the this directory

Notes:
- So far, all this is stored in Chrome local storage, so it can't store too much yet.
- I'm no UI engineer, so this was almost all written by Claude 3.5
