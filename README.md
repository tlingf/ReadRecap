This Chrome extension reminds you of articles you have read (spent 3+ minutes on), and allows you to add recaps so you can review them later (more functionality to add around that).

This tries to filter to articles, blogs, and podcasts (also showing github pages for now)

To run:
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Turn on Developer mode on the right
- Go to "Load unpacked" and select the the ReadingCompanion directory

Notes:
- So far, all this is stored in Chrome local storage, so it can't store too much yet.
